## Feature Request: Add New Language Support

**Describe the base language and target language you want to add**
Please specify:
- **Base Language:** The language you want to use as the source.
- **Target Language:** The language you want to translate to (other than English).

**Do you have a URL to a dictionary or resource?**
If you have found a dictionary or resource that supports the languages mentioned, please provide the URL and specify the file format (e.g., ZIP, JSON, XML). For example:
- **URL:** [http://example.com/dictionary.zip](http://example.com/dictionary.zip)
- **File Format:** ZIP

**Do you have URLs for dictionaries for other target languages?**
If you have found URLs for dictionaries supporting other target languages, please list them here. This helps us understand if there's potential for expanding support further.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. For example:
*I would like to add support for [Base Language] to [Target Language] by incorporating the provided dictionary URL into the **vocabulizer-dictionary-cli** tool. Please guide me on how to create or update the necessary installer script and configuration files.*

**Additional context**
Add any additional information, resources, or screenshots that might help with the implementation of the new language support.

Thank you for considering this feature request!
